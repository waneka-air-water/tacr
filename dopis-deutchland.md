We as a company feel the strain of the current situation on the market of
energies and inputs does to our product creation. For this and economic
reasons, we are very interested in the proposed technological solution of
collecting, filtering, and accumulating rainwater with the goal of more
usage in our technological process. This project seems to us to have all
the attributes we consider for the successful move of our industry toward
a more sustainable and economically advantageous future.

We are very interested in becoming the testbed and commercial outputs of
the bespoken project. We are looking forward to closer cooperation with the
research team.
